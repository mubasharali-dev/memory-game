        Memory Game is basically a mind memory game. Sounds Confusing? Let me
        explain you more. The first is to take one card and search for that card
        from the all cards. You have to remember the previous card you clicked.
        When the card you got previously and current card are same, you'll jump
        to match the next two cards.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The more cards you remember at one time the more faster you win the
        game.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        This matching game is about to match 2 cards of same images from 24
        cards. All the cards are hidden by a same Image card.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Click the card and search for that same second card from entire list. If
        two cards are not same, those cards will flip back again and the loop
        will continues.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        To know about card names and their visual representation, please visit
        <a href="/pages/cards.html">Cards.</a>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        As you can see, all the cards are hidden by one JavaScript Badge. So
        there is no chance to get the same card at same place everytime. It'll
        be changed after every new game. You short term mind memory will surely
        help you to win this game. Thank you!
